## :clipboard: Description

The **supermercash** project is based on the problem where a user has several markets close to his residence, and is left with the doubt of which of the markets his **shopping list** would be cheaper?

The application proposes that the user assembles his shopping list with the desired items, then the prices of his purchase will be presented in each of the markets, available in order, so that the user can easily choose the best **cost- benefit**.

In addition to observing the best value for the purchase, the user can make the purchase through the application itself, using information from the **user card**.
